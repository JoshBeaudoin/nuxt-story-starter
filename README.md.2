*For this project i had struggled alot and am not too sure if i did it correctly but had been way to overwhelmed with all of the work lately i didnt get a chance to get help for this specific project.
*I find storyblok very easy i made the components no isses but my problem is with vue i just dont think i understand how to use it just yet, i belive i did everything right but i am not confident in it
*For the three components i had to add i went with ones i know well which is button_link, button_text and Logo as i have had to make them a bunch so i can set them up and i believe i did the nuxt stuff correctly i hadnt seen any problem there it was just confusing for the vues aspect of it.
*I have styled the background to be different colours as my style theme as i wasnt sure what else would really look good.
*What i learned from doing this project is that i still need to do some work with vue so i can get a better understanding of how to add things to my vscode.
